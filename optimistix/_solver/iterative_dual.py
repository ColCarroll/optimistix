#
# NOTE: This method is usually called Levenberg-Marquardt. However,
# Levenberg-Marquard often refers specifically to the case where this approach
# is applied in the Gauss-Newton setting. For this reason, we refer to the approach
# by the more generic name "iterative dual."
#
# Iterative dual is a method of solving for the descent direction given a
# trust region radius. It does this by solving the dual problem
# `(B + λ I) p = r` for `p`, where `B` is the quasi-Newton matrix,
# lambda is the dual parameter (the dual parameterisation of the
# trust region radius), `I` is the identity, and `r` is the vector of residuals.
#
# Iterative dual is approached in one of two ways:
# 1. set the trust region radius and find the Levenberg-Marquadt parameter
# `lambda` which will give approximately solve the trust region problem. ie.
# solve the dual of the trust region problem.
#
# 2. set the Levenberg-Marquadt parameter `lambda` directly.
#
# Respectively, this is the indirect and direct approach to iterative dual.
# The direct approach is common in practice, and is often interpreted as
# interpolating between quasi-Newton and gradient based approaches.

#
# Note that the damping (aka Levenberg-Marquard parameter) of `_DirectIterativeDual` is
# `delta`, but in `DirectIterativeDual` it is `1/delta`. It is easier to find the
# correct damping using a Newton solve with the former, but for line searches we
# usually assume that the smaller the value of `delta` the smaller the step that we
# take.
#
# In particular, if we do the eigendecomposition
# `p = -(B + λ I)^(-1) g = -U (Λ + λ I) U^T g`
# then the square of the two norm of `p` as a function of `λ` is
# ```
# ||p||**2 = sum [U g]_i/((λ_i + λ)**2)
# ```
# where `λ_i = Λ_i` is the ith eigenvector of `B` and `[U g]_i` is the `ith` element
# of the vector `U g`.
# From this we see that the parameterising `1/delta` can be viewed as
# approximately controlling the norm of `p`.
