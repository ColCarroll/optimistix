CG.__init__.__doc__ = r"""**Arguments:**

- `rtol`: Relative tolerance for terminating solve.
- `atol`: Absolute tolerance for terminating solve.
- `normal`: Whether to solve using the normal equations: that is, to solve $Ax=b$ by
    first multiplying by $A^\intercal$ to obtain $A^\intercal Ax = A^\intercal b$, and
    then applying the conjugate gradient method to the resulting (positive definite)
    system. Note that this approach squares the condition number, so it is not
    recommended. (The resulting solution is relatively cheap to compute, but generally
    not very accurate, especially if using 32-bit floats.)
- `norm`: The norm to use when computing whether the error falls within the tolerance.
    Defaults to the L-infinity norm.
- `stabilise_every`: The conjugate gradient is an iterative method that produces
    candidate solutions $x_1, x_2, \ldots$, and terminates once $r_i = \| Ax_i - b \|$
    is small enough. For computational efficiency, the values $r_i$ are computed using
    other internal quantities, and not by directly evaluating the formula above.
    However, this computation of $r_i$ is susceptible to drift due to limited
    floating-point precision. Every `stabilise_every` steps, then $r_i$ is computed
    directly using the formula above, in order to stabilise the computation.
- `max_steps`: The maximum number of iterations to run the solver for. If more steps
    than this are required, then the solve is halted with a failure.
