    **Attributes:**

    - `value`: The solution to the solve.
    - `result`: An integer representing whether the solve was successful or not. This
        can be converted into a human-readbale error message via
        `optimistix.RESULTS[result]`
    - `aux`: Any user-specified auxiliary data returned from the problem; defaults to
        `None` if there is no auxiliary data. Auxiliary outputs can be captured by
        setting a `has_aux=True` flag, e.g.
        `optx.root_findRoot(fn, has_aux=True, ...)`.
    - `stats`: Statistics about the solver, e.g. the number of steps that were required.
    - `state`: The internal state of the solver. The meaning of this is specific to each
        solver.
