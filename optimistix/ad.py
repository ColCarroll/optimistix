    """Rewrites gradients via the implicit function theorem.

    **Arguments:**

    - `fn_primal` is a function `(inputs, closure) -> (root, residual)`.
    - `fn_rewrite` is a function `(root, residual, inputs, closure) -> arbitrary`.
    - `inputs` is some input PyTree of the primal inputs to the computation.
    - `closure` is an arbitrary Python object, used to pass auxiliary inputs to the
        computation.
    - `tags`: any tags (symmetric, diagonal, ...) for the matrix
        `d(fn_rewrite)/d(root)`.
    - `linear_solver`: an `lx.AbstractLinearSolver`, used to solve the linear problem
        on the backward pass.

    Note that due to limitations with JAX's custom autodiff, both `fn_primal` and
    `fn_rewrite` should be global functions (i.e. they should not capture any JAX array
    via closure, even if it does not participate in autodiff).

    **Returns:**

    This function returns `fn_primal(inputs, closure)`. The first output is the output
    primal, whilst the second is auxiliary information.

    The primals have tangents `-(d(fn_rewrite)/d(root))^-1 d(fn_rewrite)/d(inputs)`,
    evaluated at `(root, residual, inputs, closure)`.
